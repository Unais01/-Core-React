Starting advance react learning on 9 sept 2024 with jhon smilga from (coding addicts)
## Description
This repository documents my learning journey with core React concepts using Vite. It includes practical exercises and examples to build a solid foundation in React development.

### Key Topics Covered:
- **React Components**: Creating and managing functional components.
- **State Management**: Managing dynamic data using `useState`.
- **Event Handling**: Handling user interactions such as button clicks, form submissions, and more.
- **React Hooks**: 
  - `useState`: Manage state in functional components.
  - `useEffect`: Handle side effects like data fetching or subscriptions.
  - `useRef`: Access and manipulate DOM elements.
  - `useContext`: Share data between components without prop drilling.
- **Custom Hooks**: Creating reusable hooks to simplify complex logic.
- **React Forms**: Managing form inputs, validation, and submission.
- **Context API and Prop Drilling**: Efficiently passing data to deeply nested components, avoiding prop drilling issues.
